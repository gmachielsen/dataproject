Purpose: • To create a backendless artist page for my dad, who is an artist as hobby. Needs it fulfils: • Ability for users to view his artwork and to contact him, by using a htmlform and abilities to contact him on whatsapp, e-mail, instagram and facebook,(as there is no backend, the contactform is just a styled html form.).

I have used the following techniques:

Bootstrap:

This is used for the development of the lay out of this dashboard, namely 2 rows of 3 columns.

dc.js a dimensional charting javascrpt library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets.

d3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

CSS this is used, to make the hover effect and for styling the colors and fonts of this dashboard. 

Deployment
This data project is deployed via githubpages.
